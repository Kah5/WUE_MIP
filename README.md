# WUE_MIP

## This repository contains code to read in regional runs of ecosystem models from Paleon Project, calculate ecosytem water use efficiency and growth changes, and compare to ecologically sampled tree ring data and & ITRDB tree ring data.

## Scripts to read in regional runs include:

## Code to calculate WUE and make WUE change figures:

WUE_GWBI_plots.R

## Code to estimate parameters for growth responses to climate:

Species_GWBI_split_train_test.R
08b_total_gwbi_models_ecological.R
